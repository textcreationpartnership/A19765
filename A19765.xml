         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Hoſpitalitie truly ſo called is taken either in a large, or in a ſtrict ſenſe. In a large ſenſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the works of charity and mercy and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous kindeneſſe, ſpecially the feaſting of mean neighbours, the relieving of the poore, and the entertaining of honeſt gueſts and travellers of the ſame countrey. Thus it is taken by King James in that punctuall and pertinent paſſage of his Works, which I keep till the end of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as a dainty morſel for the cloſure of an home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feaſt. And ſo it is hoſpitalitie to build houſes for the blinde and maimed, the aged and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, for poore widows and young orphanes, which are either paſt their labour, or not come to it, as many Princes and Prelates and other devout perſons have done in former times, and in latter ages. For ſuch houſes and manſions endowed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9698:12"/> with revenues are commonly called Hoſpitals, though they be not <hi>Xenodochia,</hi> receptacles of nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtrangers and foreiners, but <hi>Ptochodochia</hi> or <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chotrophia,</hi> nurſeries for the poore of the countrey. It was hoſpitalitie when Abigail relieved David and his followers with two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five ſheep ready dreſſed,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.18.</note> and other commodities: when Shobi, Machir, and Barzillai brought beds,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 17.27, 28, 29.</note> and baſins, and earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and divers kindes of victuals for him and for the people that were with him hungry, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thirſty in the wilderneſſe: when Job did not eat his morſel alone,<note place="margin">Job 31.17, 19, 20.</note> but made the fatherleſſe eat thereof, and warmed the poore with the fleece of his ſheep:<note place="margin">Eſther 9.22.</note> when the Iſraelites in their feaſts and good dayes ſent gifts to the poore,<note place="margin">Neh. 8.10, 12.</note> and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto them for whom nothing was prepared: when Martha and others received our Saviour into their houſes,<note place="margin">Luke 10.38.</note> and gave him kinde entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Finally, it was hoſpitality which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them that would keep a true religious faſt, Eſay 58.7. <hi>To deal their bread to the hungry, to cover him whom they ſaw naked, and not to hide themſelves from their own fleſh:</hi> and unto which Chriſt exhorted his hoſte, Luke 14.12. ſaying, <hi>When thou makeſt a dinner or a ſupper,</hi>

                     <p>Of this laſt the Text is to be underſtood: for, as Gualther hath well obſerved upon it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

                     <p>When the Iſraelites poſſeſſed Canaan, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers might come among them by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whether they deſired but to paſſe through the land, or to ſojourn there for a while, till the buſineſſe for which they came was ended; or whether they purpoſed to dwell there altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                     <p>Whether it be fitting and expedient to admit ſtrangers into the publick government of a Common-wealth, and advance them unto great offices &amp; places of importance, I leave to Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Hiſtorians to diſcuſſe and diſcourſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to meddle with theſe matters that are too high for me.

                     <p>Fourthly, to procure the relief of thoſe that are in want and neceſſitie.

Whence S.

Thus Archbiſhop Parker dealt with Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius: for meeting him in London, <hi>he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt force him to leave the inne, and to take lodging at his Palace.</hi> For innes and taverns are places of great charges and expenſes, which every ſtranger and paſſenger is not able to beare.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In a cheerfull entertainment. For Saint Peter bids the faithfull to whom he writes, to <hi>uſe hoſpitality without grudging:</hi> that is, without repining at the number, or long ſtay, or charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of their gueſts, which thoſe times of perſecution did cauſe. And S.

Cor. 9.7. Now cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9698:18"/> implies three things. Firſt, Alacrity and <hi>willingneſſe of minde:</hi>

                        <hi>for of gifts the minde is the beſt part.</hi> The grace of a benefit is voluntarineſſe, the freeneſſe of the minde and the openneſſe of the heart.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9698:22"/> of his gueſts, becauſe he was his brother, not by the fathers ſide onely, as they were, but alſo by the mothers: So we ſhould make more of thoſe ſtrangers which are children with us, not onely of the ſame God by creation, but alſo of the ſame Church by beleef and profeſſion. And as there is another manner of uſe of things holy and of things common, of the Lords day and of the other dayes of the week: So a difference is to be made between true Proteſtants and other common Chriſtians: Of thoſe there muſt be a ſpeciall regard above theſe that are not ſo linked unto us by the band of Religion. For we ought herein to imitate God, who though he be <hi>good to all</hi> (Pſal. 145.9.) <hi>yet</hi> in a ſpeciall ſort he <hi>is good to Iſrael</hi> (Pſal. 73.1.) <hi>Who is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all men, ſpecially of thoſe that beleeve,</hi> 1.

                     <p>Thirdly, More eſpecially ſtrangers perſecuted and baniſhed for profeſſing the true Religion. For we love the truth as we love the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that profeſſe it and ſuffer for it.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9698:23"/> Therefore Aſa and Hezechiah Kings of Juda re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived willingly thoſe ſtrangers that came to them out of Iſrael,<note place="margin">2.

                     <p>Thirdly, Rich Lay-men and Women. For when the Apoſtle requires of Clergy-men to be hoſpital, he doth not thereby exclude or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt Lay-men from this duty, but onely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Miniſters ſhould be eminent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as in all other good works, ſo in this branch of charity to ſtrangers and foreiners. Otherwiſe, it is no more proper to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters then other duties there enjoyned by the Apoſtle; as modeſty, ſobriety, juſtice, holineſſe, and temperance: which without all queſtion lie upon the people as well as upon the Paſtours.

                     <p>Fourthly, Poore Lay-men and Women. For though they have neither ſilver nor gold, yet

There are among ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers many able ones that need not any mans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence, and they that ſtand in need thereof are well ſatisfied with the good words of thoſe that can ſhew them no good deeds.

Having therefore inſiſted upon the Nature, the Kindes, the Parts, the Object, the Subject, and the Means of hoſpitalitie; it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to adjoyn the chief Motives or Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to it: Which are of two ſorts; either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and common to other Moral vertues, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and proper to this in hand. The generall and common Motives are five: The Precept and Preſident of God, the Examples of the godly, the Practice of Infidels, the manifold Profit wherewith it is rewarded, the divers Detriments whereby the contrary vice is puniſhed.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9698:42"/> he ſaith to us, <hi>Be given to hoſpitalitie?</hi> Again, Shall the actions of the leaders be a great ſpurre to the followers to do as the others do before them, and ſhall not Gods example be a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to us to the performance of this good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Naturally the younger do tread the ſteps of the elders, ſervants do as their maſters do, children walk like their fathers, and ſubjects think it a kinde of obedience to imitate the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their Kings and Governours. <hi>Look on me, and do likewiſe,</hi> ſaith Gedeon to his ſouldiers:<note place="margin">Judges 7.17.</note>

                     <p>Now the reaſon why all ancient Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (except ſome altogether brutiſh and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and hated of all the reſt for their ſavage

                     <p>Secondly, by diſcharging faithfully that office that he is preferred unto, as Joſeph, Daniel, Mordecai, Sleidan: who being a Low-countriman behaved himſelf ſo vertuouſly at Argentine or Strasbourg, that they truſted him with the weightieſt affairs of their Commonwealth, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9698:64"/> made him their Leiger to England, and to the Councell of Trent: where he ever diſcharged his Commiſſion to his own great praiſe, and to the full content and ſatisfaction of thoſe that ſent him.

                        </note> not by the feaſt and coſt of his hoſte.

                     <p>Secondly, by doing to him what good office he can. For an ingenuous diſpoſition cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive favours without thoughts of return. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou hast been carefull for us with all this care,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Remember that before Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas twelve moneth I made a Proclamation for this cauſe, that all Gentlemen of qualitie ſhould depart to their own countreys and houſes, to maintain hoſpitality among their neighbours; which was equivocally taken by ſome, as that it was meant onely for that Chriſtmas: But my will and meaning was that it ſhould alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
                  <p>—It is the faſhion of Italy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Naples (which is one of the richeſt parts of it) that all the Gentry dwell in the principall Townes, and ſo the whole countrey is emptie: Even ſo now in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, all the countrey is gotten into Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; ſo as with time England will onely be London, and the whole countrey be left waſte. For as we now do imitate the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:9698:71"/> French faſhion, in faſhion of clothes and lackeys to follow every man; So have we got up the Italian faſhion, in living miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in our houſe, and dwelling all in the Citie. But let us in Gods name leave theſe idle forein toyes, and keep the old faſhion of England: for it was wont to be the honour and reputation of the Engliſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, to live in the Countrey, and keep hoſpitalitie; for which we were famous above all the Countreys in the World; which we may the better do, having a ſoil abundantly fertile to live in.</p>
                  <p>And now out of mine own mouth I declare unto you (which being in this place is equal to a Proclamation, which I intend likewiſe ſhortly hereafter to have publikely proclaimed) that the Courtiers, Citizens, and Lawyers, and thoſe that belong unto them, and others as have Pleas in Terme time, are onely neceſſarie perſons to remain about this Citie; others muſt get them into the Countrey. For beſide the having of the Countrey deſolate, when the Gentrie dwell thus in London, divers other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ariſe upon it. Firſt, if inſurrections
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:9698:71"/> ſhould fall out (as was lately ſeen by the Levellers gathering together) what order can be taken with it, when the Countrey is unfurniſhed of Gentlemen to take order with it? Next, the poore want relief for fault of the Gentlemens hoſpitalitie at home. Thirdly, my ſervice is neglected, and the good government of the Countrey, for lack of the principall Gentlemens preſence that ſhould perform it. And laſtly, the Gentlemen loſe their own thrift, for lack of their own preſence, in ſeeing to their own buſineſſe at home. Therefore as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fiſh lives in his own place, ſome in the freſh, ſome in the ſalt, ſome in the mud: ſo let every one live in his own place, ſome at Court, ſome in the Citie, ſome in the Countrey; ſpecially at Feſtivall times, as Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and Eaſter, and the reſt.</p>
